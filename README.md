# AnomalyDetection_CVPR18

Implementation of [Real-world Anomaly Detection in Surveillance Videos](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.04264.pdf) paper from CVPR 2018.
Original implementation from authors is [here](https://github.com/WaqasSultani/AnomalyDetectionCVPR2018).

Download C3D sports-1m weights from [here](https://github.com/adamcasson/c3d/releases/download/v0.1/sports1M_weights_tf.h5) and 
save them to 'trained_models' folder as 'c3d_sports1m.h5'.

Run demo.py to run the code on the demo video in 'input' folder. Visualization of the predictions from the model is saved in 'output' folder.

Will adding the training code soon...!!
